Aim of this project is to facilitate my father’s job and increase his business’ productivity. There are many market managing programs on the internet. I wanted to save him from any extra expenses. I worked by my father and made many conversations to understand which operations, features and GUIs my father does require. 
Used libraries:
  •	Java.awt
  •	Java.sql
  •	Java.swing

The program has two packages:
  •	market
